# Operation: Frozen Hell

## What this is about
As a linux poweruser, I already use Linux on every productive System that I am allowed to install it on.
For a long time now I am wondering, wether I could replace windows on my gaming rig, too.
Like, combining productivitity and leisure. Have Linux as a viable gaming system.
People tend to assume this wasn't even possible. Someone even told me that this will happen when hell freezes over.

Well, what can I say...for me, this day has come.
I've tested [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) for a few weekds now, and was able to migrate nearly everything, causing me to decide to do the swap now.

In this repo I want to share my journey, problems I encountered and how I solved them.

## Why I chose Garuda Linux

## Native applications
- Mozilla Thunderbird
- Mozilla Firefox, Chrome, ...
- Davinci Resolve Studio 
- IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, ...
- 

## Successfull migrations:

| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Steam              | Game Launcher             | none        | Native, Proton    |
| iCue (Keyboard)    | Keyboard lighting/macros  | ckb-next    | install [ckb-next](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ckb-next/) |
| iCue (fan control) | Commander Pro fan Control | TBA         | TBA               |

## Impossible migrations

| Application/Task                        | Reason                                              |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Ubisoft Connect Games w/Easy Anti Cheat | They use a pre-Epic EAC with no wine/proton support |
