# Operation: Frozen Hell

## What this is about
As a linux poweruser, I already use Linux on every productive System that I am allowed to install it on.
For a long time now I am wondering, wether I could replace windows on my gaming rig, too.
Like, combining productivitity and leisure. Have Linux as a viable gaming system.
People tend to assume this wasn't even possible. Someone even told me that this will happen when hell freezes over.

Well, what can I say...for me, this day has come.
I've tested [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) for a few weekds now, and was able to migrate nearly everything, causing me to decide to do the swap now.

In this repo I want to share my journey, problems I encountered and how I solved them.
